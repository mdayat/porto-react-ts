# Welcome to my Portofolio React-Typescript Repository
I created this repository to implement the React-Typescript technology I just learned a few days ago. The **blue** color I chose represents the technology I use, namely Typescript. Hope you enjoy my little work, and for a **better experience**. Use a device that is at least 768px wide and above.
I optimize the site that I made as best as I can, starting from "unnecessary rendering", "single responsibility code" etc.
